#### Overview

Teaching machine to learn has been in works for a very long time. While Machine Learning algorithms seem fancier on the outside (like a blackbox), Machine Learning has **mathematics** at its core. One might say, the "M" in Machine Learning stands for 'Math' (pun intended :p).

Numerous courses online have made Machine Learning a plug-and-play game using pre-built libraries. However, that's not how machine learning actually works. One must understand the logic or the back-story behind various ML algorithms to entirely appreciate this field. This online book was built around this objective. Stanford's Machine Learning explains the extensive mathematics behind ML in detail. Hence, their lecture videos on YouTube are chosen as the means for material in this book.

#### Goals

The goals of this course (as discussed in the lecture series) are:

1. By the end of this lecture series the aim is to make the reader an expert in Machine Learning. (i.e., reader must be able to comprehend how ML algorithms work internally.)
   
2. Enable the reader to build Machine Learning applications, which means to have an understanding of what ML algorithms to use in a given scenario. Not all problems are good Machine Learning problems.
   
3. Enable the reader to do Machine Learning research.

<span class='nital'>"The first is that I entirely avoid code listings. I believe that in most cases books are not an appropriate place for code listingsâ€”software engineering books are an obvious exception."</span>

Some AI-related books (like the one mentioned above) teach the theory behind AI/ML. To extend these concepts to practical applications, code from multiple courses is consolidated in a way that enables comprehensive connection between modules. <span class = 'nital'>*This online-book is made to integrate the benefits of both coding environments and reference books.*</span>
```
I have tried to write the entire code in this book from scratch. Through this book, I aim to teach Machine Learning from the ground-up so that readers can appreciate it's (ML's) true potential from a <span class='high'>mathematical perspective while extending their learnings to industrial applications.</span>
